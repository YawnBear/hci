A Beta version prototype of the user interface has been developed using Next.js platform, built with JavaScript and React. It incorporates several visual and audio APIs, as well as some other external APIs including data.gov.my weather data API and Gemini LLM API. The style of the prototype is designed to be in mobile structure, therefore requiring users to switch to mobile view while viewing it on computers.

It requires a .env.local to store Gemini API key, GEMINI_API_KEY. Gemini API Key can be obtained through Google AI Studio.
